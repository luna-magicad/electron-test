# electron-test
Testing building an electron app.

## How to build dev
1) Run `npm run build-ts-watch` so that typescript files are updated every time they are updated.
2) Run `npm run start` which will copy index.html and set up live reload for the electron app whenever a .js or .html file is updated.
